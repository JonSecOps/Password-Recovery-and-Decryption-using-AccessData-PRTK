# Password Recovery and Decryption using AccessData PRTK

**Project Summary**

This project involved a digital forensics and cryptography-based exercise in which encrypted files were analyzed and decrypted using both automated and manual techniques. Acting as a senior forensic examiner at ACME Corp., the objective was to demonstrate technical proficiency in password recovery, cryptographic decoding, and data decryption as part of an annual training and recertification task.

Using AccessData’s Password Recovery Toolkit (PRTK), the project focused on analyzing multiple encrypted ZIP files—some requiring brute-force or dictionary-based password recovery, and others demanding manual decryption methods such as Caesar cipher and transposition ciphers. The examiner verified file integrity using MD5 hash validation, created custom dictionaries, and applied logic-based decryption to uncover hidden messages and passwords.

The investigation validated the effectiveness of hybrid techniques—automated cracking with PRTK and manual cipher decoding—to recover access to protected data efficiently and accurately.

**Learning Points**

1. Gained hands-on experience with AccessData’s PRTK, including setting up password recovery sessions and verifying hash integrity.
2. Learned how to apply classical cryptographic decryption methods (e.g., Caesar cipher, transposition cipher) for manual password recovery.
3. Developed an understanding of dictionary-based attacks and the creation of custom dictionaries to optimize cracking speed.
4. Strengthened ability to validate forensic data integrity using MD5 hashing and preservation of evidence procedures.
5. Learned how encryption, ciphertext, and plaintext interact within forensic recovery workflows.
6. Enhanced analytical reasoning and problem-solving through iterative decryption and cipher analysis.
